/*
The Quaternion structure.  The math can seem a bit complex/arbitrary, but really the high-level ideas are easy to grasp.

Quaternions are primarily used to represent rotation in 3D.  The w represents the angle of the rotation, and the x, y, and z represent the vector to rotate about (although the numbers don't exactly line up).

Multiplying two quaternions combines the rotations as if they were done in sequence (note: order matters).

If you want to learn more about the specifics of Quaternions, the internet has a number of sources to look at.
